# Computer-Vision-Project

This project involves using different models and methods to obtain results from video footages.

## Depth-Anything:
- You can find the model to download and following steps from this link: https://github.com/LiheYoung/Depth-Anything/tree/main
```
cd Depth-Anythin
python run_video.py --encoder vits --video-path "./video1.mp4" --outdir video_depth_vis
```

## object_detection:
```
cd object_detection
python object_detection.py
```

## instance_segmentation:
```
cd instance_segmentation
python instance_segmentation.py
```

## license_plate_detection:
```
cd license_plate_detection
python license_plate_detection.py
```

## distance_estimation:
```
cd distance_estimation
python distance_estimation.py
```

## vehicle_bicycle_distance_estimation:
```
cd vehicle_bicycle_distance_estimation
python vehicle_bicycle_distance_estimation.py
```
